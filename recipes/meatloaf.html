    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
        The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread Crumbs
            Use store-bought or homemade seasoned bread crumbs. </li>
        <li>Milk
            Milk is absorbed into the bread crumbs, adding much-needed moisture. </li>
        <li>Eggs
            Two whole eggs help bind the meatloaf together. Plus, they lend richness and extra moisture. </li>
        <li>Beef
            Traditional meatloaf is made with ground beef, which is what this recipe calls for. Some reviewers say they've gotten great results with ground turkey. </li>
        <li>Mushrooms
            Sliced mushrooms offer earthy flavor. If you're not a fan, you can leave them out.</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Prepare the Meatloaf</h4>
            Whisk together milk, bread crumbs, eggs, minced onion, salt, and sage. Stir in ground beef and mushrooms. Shape the mixture into a round loaf that will fit into your slow cooker. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cover and Cook</h4>
            Place the formed loaf into your slow cooker and cook on low for five to six hours. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Glaze the Meatloaf</h4>
            Whisk together the ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. Open the slow cooker and pour the glaze evenly over the loaf. Re-cover and continue to cook on low for about 15 more minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Serve the Meatloaf</h4>
            Remove the meatloaf and transfer to a serving plate. Cover with foil for about 10 minutes to trap in the juices, then slice and serve. 
        </li>
        
    </ol>
